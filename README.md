<p align="center">A little game about dice and randomness made for the GMTK Game Jam 2022</p>

<hr>

**An unusual dice's QUEST** *(or AUDQ for friends)* is a very, very small game that I had the pleasure of developing for **GMTK Game Jam 2022** as my first moderately serious title. I have to mention that **I have been in charge of creating all the assets of the game** using free tools such as Paint 3D and soundtrap, except for the fonts used in the game sprites. This title is, like most independent titles, [published on itch.io](https://h3nry-d1az.itch.io/audq), so you can visit that page to **get the binaries of the game** or go through the [releases section](https://github.com/h3nry-d1az/audq/releases).

#### Download instructions for any other platform

I hope you enjoy it and if so, please **leave a positive review, give the project a star and share it**, it would help me a lot.

> P.S: This repository only contains the **assets and the code of the project**, so if you are looking for the entire source code, **go through the pages mentioned previously**.
